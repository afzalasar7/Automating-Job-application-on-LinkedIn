# Automating-Job-application-on-LinkedIn
This project is designed to automate the job application process on LinkedIn. It uses web scraping techniques and the Selenium WebDriver library in Python to automatically fill out and submit job applications on the LinkedIn platform.

To run the project, you will need to install the following dependencies:

Selenium: pip install selenium
ChromeDriver: download the latest version from https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads and add it to your system path
Python Dotenv: pip install python-dotenv
Once you have installed these dependencies, you can run the program using the command line interface. The program takes several arguments, including the LinkedIn login credentials, the name of the company to search for, the job title to search for, and the location to search in. It then navigates to the relevant job postings, fills out the application forms, and submits the applications automatically.

This project can be useful for anyone looking to save time and streamline their job search on LinkedIn. However, it is important to use the program responsibly and in compliance with LinkedIn's terms of service.
